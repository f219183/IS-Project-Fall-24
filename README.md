# Automated Web Vulnerabilities Detection Tool 

**Introduction:** 
This project proposes the development of a web security tool designed to automatically 
detect three critical vulnerabilities in web applications: Cross-Site Request Forgery 
(CSRF), Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and cryptographic weaknesses. These 
vulnerabilities are widely recognized as major threats in web security, as highlighted by 
the OWASP Top 10.  
The tool will provide a streamlined solution, allowing developers and testers to identify 
these vulnerabilities without the need for extensive manual testing or specialized 
knowledge. The goal is to automate security testing, making it more accessible and 
efficient, particularly for teams with limited security expertise. 

**Objective:**   
The project’s primary goal is to create an automated system that:
• Accepts a website’s URL as input.
• Scans the website to detect vulnerabilities related to CSRF, XSS, and 
cryptographic practices.
• Utilizes web crawling to identify potential attack vectors, such as input fields and 
forms, and assesses their security. 

**Technical Approach:** 
The system will consist of three core testing modules:  
1. CSRF Detection: 
a. The tool will crawl the website, identify forms and actions, and check for 
proper CSRF protection mechanisms. 
b. It will verify the presence and correct implementation of CSRF tokens by 
simulating fake requests to determine if vulnerabilities exist. 
2. XSS Detection: 
a. The system will scan input fields and parameters to detect potential XSS 
vulnerabilities. 
b. It will inject malicious scripts to test input sanitization and encoding, 
targeting reflected, stored, and DOM-based XSS vulnerabilities. 
3. Cryptography Check: 
a. The tool will evaluate the website’s cryptographic setup, focusing on 
SSL/TLS configurations and encryption methods. 
b. It will identify outdated algorithms, weak ciphers, and improper handling of 
sensitive data, like unencrypted transmissions.

# Significance:
The tool aims to make security testing more efficient by automating traditionally manual 
processes. This will help identify vulnerabilities earlier in the development cycle, 
allowing developers and testers to secure their web applications effectively. The 
automated approach will empower teams without deep security expertise to perform 
essential vulnerability checks with ease, improving overall web security standards. 

# Conclusion:  
This project will simplify the detection of critical vulnerabilities by automating security 
tests for CSRF, XSS, and cryptographic weaknesses. It will provide an accessible 
solution for enhancing web application security, benefiting both developers and testers. 
We request your approval to proceed and welcome any feedback to refine the project 
further.
